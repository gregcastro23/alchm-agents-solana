        "COMPUTED with Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph 2.10.03, Moshier SEFLG_MOSEPH) for 1854-10-16 12:25 UT. Independently cross-checked against astronomy-engine 2.1.19, a separate implementation: every body agrees to within 0.003 degrees. Birth date: 16 October 1854, Dublin (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde infobox) BIRTH TIME IS NOT RECORDED, so the bodies are evaluated at 12:00 local mean time at Dublin, Ireland (53.3498, -6.2603) - the midpoint of the birth day, which bounds the error at half a day of motion. Consequence, measured over the birth day: the Moon stays in Leo across the whole day, so its SIGN is certain but its degree is uncertain by up to 6.0 degrees; every other body moves less than a degree. The ASCENDANT, MIDHEAVEN and HOUSE placements are therefore NOT computed and NOT claimed - the ascendant moves about 1 degree every 4 minutes, the planet 'house' field is omitted rather than filled, and the ascendant/midheaven numbers left in this chart are the pre-existing unmeasured ones. Sanity checks pass: Sun in Libra as the date requires, Mercury 21.0 degrees from the Sun (max ~28), Venus 14.4 (max ~47). Reproduce with scripts/compute-historical-natal-charts.py.",
