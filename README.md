## 📦 Development Guidelines

### Yarn and NPX Usage

This project uses **Bun exclusively** for package management (`packageManager: bun@1.3.13`). Yarn fails with a Corepack mismatch on this repo and npm triggers strict-peer warnings — use Bun for installs, scripts, and the dev server:

```bash
# ✅ Correct usage
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun dev                  # Start development server
bun run build            # Build for production
bun run test:chat        # Run the chat test suite
bun run scripts/foo.ts   # Execute TypeScript files (bunx tsx is broken in this env)

# ❌ Avoid npm / yarn
npm install              # Don't use npm
yarn install             # Don't use yarn (Corepack mismatch)
```

### Package Management Rules

- **Use Bun 1.3.x** for all dependency management
- **Use `bun run scripts/<file>.ts`** for executing TypeScript files (`bunx tsx` is currently broken in this env)
- **Keep `bun.lock` synchronized** across all environments

### Full-Stack Development

```bash
# Start both frontend and backend
make full-stack-dev

# Or manually:
bun dev                                              # Frontend (port 3000)
cd backend && uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000  # Backend (FastAPI)
```

### MCP Servers

The backend can consume the sibling Alchm MCP data server and can also expose its own persona/cognitive MCP server:

```bash
# Data layer consumed by FastAPI
ALCHM_MCP_SERVER_PATH=/Users/cookingwithcastro/Desktop/WhatToEatNext-master/mcp-server/src/index.ts

# Cognitive layer exposed to external agent clients
cd backend && python3 planetary_agents_mcp_server.py
```

The Planetary Agents MCP server exposes `chat_with_planetary_agent`, `get_agent_feed_discussion`, and `synthesize_culinary_debate` over stdio.

For complete documentation on gating, API keys, Claude Desktop configuration, and telemetry, see the detailed [Planetary Agents MCP Documentation](backend/README_MCP.md).

### Make Commands

```bash
make test-chat-system            # Run comprehensive test suite
make chat-system-status          # Show testing system status
```

## 🧪 Alchemical System

The application incorporates a unique alchemical system where:

- Each element (Fire, Water, Air, Earth) is valued independently
- Elements do not "cancel" or "oppose" each other
- Elements reinforce themselves (like strengthens like)
- All element combinations can work harmoniously together

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following configuration:

```bash
# AI API Keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key

# Database Configuration (if using)
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/planetary_agents_db?schema=public"
REDIS_URL="redis://localhost:6379"

# Galileo Logging (Optional)
GALILEO_API_KEY=your_galileo_api_key
GALILEO_PROJECT=AlchmPlanetaryAgents
GALILEO_LOG_STREAM=test
GALILEO_LOG_ENABLED=true
GALILEO_FAIL_SILENTLY=true
GALILEO_VERBOSE_FALLBACK=true
```

### Galileo Logging Flags

- `GALILEO_LOG_ENABLED`: Enable/disable logging to Galileo (default: true)
- `GALILEO_FAIL_SILENTLY`: Never throw errors, always fallback to console logging (default: true)
- `GALILEO_VERBOSE_FALLBACK`: Include detailed fallback logging information (default: true)

When `GALILEO_LOG_ENABLED=false`, all logging will be disabled.
When `GALILEO_FAIL_SILENTLY=true`, API errors will not crash the application.

### Disabling Logging Locally

To disable Galileo logging during local development:

```bash
GALILEO_LOG_ENABLED=false
```

This will skip all logging attempts and prevent any API calls to Galileo.
